<p>Artificial Intelligence, or as it’s more commonly known, AI, has been said to either transform our world into a utopia, or bring about our doom. With so many widely publicized news stories about AI systems that can generate convincingly human-like text, defeat world champions at board games that were previously thought to be too hard for a computer, or generate images of human faces that appear indistinguishable from the real things, it can seem that we are close to a point at which AI may become self-aware and pose a threat to humans.</p>
<p>To truly understand if these fears of AI surpassing human intelligence and taking over the world are justified, we must first know, what is AI?</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>What is AI? For some, it conjures up pictures from movies like Terminator and The Matrix, of robots gaining sentience and taking over the world. The term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined in 1956, by computer scientist John McCarthy, who, in his article, defines AI as “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially computer programs” <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Other people define AI in similar terms, saying that “AI is a collection of methods and ideas for building software that can do some of the things that humans can do with their brains” <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-the-history-of-ai">What is the history of AI?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-is-the-history-of-ai" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-is-the-history-of-ai">§</a>

<hr />
<p>The field of AI started in the years after the end of World War II. In 1947, the famous British mathematician and code-breaker Alan Turing gave a lecture on programming computers to develop intelligent machines <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Turing was also the creator of the Turing test, a test to determine “a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior similar to that of a human.”</p>
<p>In the 1960s, researchers at MIT developed a chatbot (a chatbot is a computer program that attempts to carry on a conversation with a human) called ELIZA which was able to pass the Turing test and show that it is possible for a computer program to create human-like text.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 80s, neural networks, a family of algorithms that are loosely based on the neurons in a human brain, were developed. Neural networks excelled at learning patterns from large amounts of data and were used to automate tasks like reading addresses from envelopes.</p>
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s more progress was made in solving large problems in AI. In 1996, IBM’s Deep Blue computer beat the world’s best chess player, and in 2000, Honda released ASIMO, a humanoid robot that was capable of walking and recognizing objects and gestures.</p>
<p>In 2010, IBM’s Watson computer beat the best human competitors on the trivia game show Jeopardy!. Since around 2012, a lot of AI research is being done in machine learning - deep learning in particular. Deep learning involves stacking layers of neural networks on top of each other to create “deep” neural networks. Neural networks are now used in most of the widely used AI applications today - digital assistants like Siri and Alexa, self-driving cars, and recommendation algorithms from Netflix, Youtube, and other social media companies are all using neural networks in some part. Neural networks currently work better than other AI techniques in many areas because of their ability to learn from large amounts of data and because of the increasing amount of computational power available to train them <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> .</p>

<hr />
<p>AI is not one single area of research, it consists of many different branches that each have different views on how to build artificially intelligent systems. There are two main types of artificial intelligence, narrow AI and general AI. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of the advances in AI have been in narrow AI: getting computers to learn how to do certain tasks as good as or better than a human. Although computers can now do certain tasks better than humans, narrow AI systems are highly specialized - a system designed for classifying images can't be used to control a robot arm <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> . One example of a branch of narrow AI would be Machine Learning, or ML. Machine learning involves teaching a computer to iteratively learn to solve a task by giving it a large amount of data to learn from. In this way, machine learning lets computers learn how to do tasks without explicitly giving it instructions on how to do so <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup> .</p>
<p>General AI involves computers that can generalize to a wide variety of tasks like humans do. So far, there has been very little progress on developing general AI, so any general AI systems are very likely decades away, if not more. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> </p>

<h2 id="in-what-areas-is-ai-being-used">In what areas is AI being used?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#in-what-areas-is-ai-being-used" aria-label="Anchor link for: in-what-areas-is-ai-being-used">§</a>

<hr />
<p>AI is being used by researchers in a wide variety of areas and for a wide variety of purposes. AI is being used in healthcare to predict the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, predict with radiologist-level accuracy whether a person has cancer from an x-ray scan, and to more accurately predict the folded structure of proteins, which is a crucial step in designing new life-saving medicines.</p>
<p>AI is also being used by companies in three main ways. First, AI is being used for RPA (Robotic Process Automation), automating time-consuming administrative tasks like transferring data from emails to spreadsheets and databases. Second, AI is being used to gain cognitive insights (which involves using algorithms to “detect patterns in vast volumes of data and interpret their meaning”) by predicting what items customers will buy next and identifying credit card fraud in real time. Finally, AI is being used for cognitive engagement (using AI to engage with potential customers) with chatbots providing customer service at any time and creating customized care plans. <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">§</a>
</h3>
<hr />
<p>Artificial intelligence today is limited to computers that can do certain tasks, sometimes as good as or even better than what a human could do, but highly specialized and limited to the scope of the task that it was trained to do. Once one knows the limitations of AI as we have it today, the claims that AI is close to surpassing human intelligence and taking over the world seem unfounded.</p>
